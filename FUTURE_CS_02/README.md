| A01  | Broken Access Control                           | A002, A005       | Multiple unauthorized file access attempts and eventual unauthorized login indicate access control gaps.                  | ‚ùå           | Implement strict RBAC, lock accounts after failed attempts. |
| A02  | Cryptographic Failures                          | ‚Äì                | No encryption-related failures detected in current log review.                                                            | ‚úÖ           | Continue monitoring for plaintext data transfers. |

| A05  | Security Misconfiguration                       | A001, A004       | Malware detection and repeated failed connections suggest possible misconfigurations in firewall/endpoint security.       | ‚ùå           | Harden system configs and review firewall rules. |
| A06  | Vulnerable and Outdated Components              | ‚Äì                | No direct evidence, but outdated components may be enabling malware exploitation.                                         | ‚ùå           | Conduct component vulnerability scans. |
| A07  | Identification and Authentication Failures      | A003, A004, A005 | Brute force attempts and eventual success show weak auth protections.                                                     | ‚ùå           | Enforce MFA, lockouts, and strong password policies. |

| A09  | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures         | All              | Alerts triggered by Splunk show logging exists, but delayed or post-event detection means improvements are needed.        | ‚ùå           | Enable real-time alerting and SIEM correlation. |
| A10  | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)               | ‚Äì                | No SSRF activity found in dataset.                                                                                        | ‚úÖ           | Continue regular SSRF testing. |

## üìò 6. Lessons Learned

In this task, Splunk was utilized as the primary SIEM tool to monitor, detect, and analyze security events. Effective SIEM operations depend on accurate log parsing and well-configured alerting rules to surface actionable insights.  

Key observations:  
- Splunk efficiently identified suspicious activities when alerts were tuned to specific thresholds and indicators.  
- Incident classification followed the **MITRE ATT&CK** and **OWASP Top 10** frameworks for standardized threat mapping.  
- Correlation between multiple potential log sources (e.g. authentication, connection) remains critical to providing full attack context.  
- Continuous tuning and review of detection rules is necessary to reduce false positives and maintain operational efficiency.
